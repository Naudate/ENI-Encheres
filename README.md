# ENI-Encheres aka ENIBay

## Summary

> The association Les objets sont nos amis wishes to set up a web platform to allow the transfer of second hand objects without financial exchange. The value of the items will be determined by an auction system based on a number of points. The points are earned by selling objects, and can then be used to acquire other objects.

The username only accepts alphanumeric characters. If the profile creation is validated, the user is directed to the homepage (list of auctions). An initial credit of 100 points is allocated upon account creation. |
| 1 | 1800 | Navigation | 6002 | Homepage | The homepage of the site is the page that lists the auctions. This page should be automatically loaded if no resource is indicated in the url (http://localhost:8080/encheres/) |
| 1 | 1750 | User Management | 1009 | Log out | As a logged-in user, I can log out. I am then returned to the homepage in logged-out mode. |
| 1 | 1700 | User Management | 1006 | View a profile | As a user, I can view the profile of a user. The username, first name, last name, email, phone number, street, zip code, and city are displayed. |

| 1 | 1400 | Auction Management | 2001 | Sell an item | As a user, I can sell an item on the ENI-Auctions platform. To do this, I provide information about the item being sold: name, description, and category. I specify a starting price (in points), an auction opening date and time, an auction closing date and time, and withdrawal arrangements (default to seller's address). |
| 1 | 1300 | Auction Management | 2004 | List ongoing auctions in disconnected mode | As a non-connected user, I can list ongoing auctions. I can filter my search by category and item name (the item is displayed if it contains the entered criteria). To view auction details, the user must log in. |
| 1 | 1200 | Auction Management | 2005 | List ongoing auctions in connected mode | As a connected user, I can list ongoing auctions, auctions in which I am participating (i.e. those on which I have made at least one bid), and my won auctions. I can also select my sales, not started, in progress, or completed. |
| 1 | 1100 | Auction Management | 2006 | Make a bid | As a user, I can make a bid on an item if I propose a price (in points) higher than the current rate and if my points balance does not become negative. If the bid is possible, my points credit is debited for the proposed amount. The previous highest bidder, if any, is re-credited with their bid. |
| 1 | 1000 | Auction Management | 2007 | Win a sale | As a bidder, I become the buyer if, at the end of the auction, I have proposed the highest bid. |

The information about the item being sold is displayed (name, description, highest offer, starting price, start and end of the auction, pick-up address, seller). Depending on the status of the sale and the role of the user (seller or buyer), the user can only view the information, bid, or modify the sale (if they are the seller and the auction has not yet started). |
| 1 | 850 | Navigation | 6001 | Refresh and browser back buttons | As a user, I can refresh the current page or go back to the previous page using the browser's back button. |

| 2 | 400 | User management | 1005 | Forgot password | As a user, I can request a password reset. The platform creates a link to a screen for entering the new password. (This link will be sent by email to the user. Email sending is not requested.) |
| 3 | 350 | Auction management | 2010 | Pagination | On the page for listing auctions according to search criteria, I display a maximum number of auctions (6) and access other result pages through numbered links. |
