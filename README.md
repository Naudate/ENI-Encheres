# ENI-Encheres aka ENIBay
## Summary

This projet was a 2 weeks challenge from ENI Ã©cole informatique.

>The association "Les objets sont nos amis" wishes to set up a web platform to allow the transfer of second hand objects without financial exchange. The value of the items will be determined by an auction system based on a number of points. The points are earned by selling objects, and can then be used to acquire other objects.

## Thanks
